Pomodoro Desktop Application
============================

Once started, an icon should be living in system tray
The system tray icon should have the following options:
- Start a new pomo
- About Pomo
- Exit

Clicking on a start pomo should start a new pomo in the background. Hovering on the system tray icon should show the count down time.
Once the pomo is done, a notification has to be shown, saying that the pomo is over and can take a break for 5 mins.
A new pomo has to start, with a notification, once the break time is over.

Clicking on 'About Pomo' should popup a window giving some basic info about pomo.

Clicking Exit should exit the application


- Can we include sounds effects?
- Can we improve styles?
- Can we have the time in mins left as text on the system tray icon?
